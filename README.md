Description
This program represents the trips from Riverside to Moreno Valley, Perris, and Hemet using an adjacency matrix. It calculates the shortest paths and the minimum cost for the marketing specialist. The representation of trips is displayed, and then the shortest paths and minimum cost are computed from the source node (Riverside). The distances are measured in miles, and the cost is assumed to be proportional to the distance traveled.

Useage:
To use the program, simply compile and run it, and it will automatically calculate the shortest paths and minimum cost based on the given city distances.
